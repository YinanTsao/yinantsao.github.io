The Cross-stack Adaptation for the Edgification of Microservices Applications research project, also called RAINDROP, started in September 2022.

<br/><br />

It aims to address in a unique way the challenge of building, deploying, and operating applications on upcoming cloud infrastructures formed of a continuum of core (data centers) and edge resources.

<br/><br />

The goal is to allow application designers to build and gradually adapt microservices applications from a cloud (data center) target towards novel distributed cloud infrastructures such as the edge-cloud continuum and multi-site (micro-cloud) environments.

<br/><br />

It targets the demanding class of collaborative and latency-sensitive applications for which the use of edge resources close to users should allow interactions and collaborations with greatly reduced latencies and increased responsiveness, enabling new classes of usages such as collaborative work in near-real-time, virtual spaces, or smart environments.

<br /><br />

At the heart of the project lies the synergy between three complementary forms of adaptation:

<ul>
  <li>for applications deployment, placement, and configuration during their execution,</li>
  <li>for the support infrastructure under dynamic demand and availability of resources,</li>
  <li>and through the necessary software evolution to make applications increasingly able to benefit from such automated runtime deployments over the edge-core continuum.</li>
</ul>

The interoperation between these different classes of adaptations leverages common application and infrastructure models, and enable a feedback loop between runtime observations and developers enacting software evolution. RAINDROP leverages best practices in cloud application development and operation, and intend to significantly improve programmability and abstraction for cloud developers wishing to take advantage of the promising, but demanding and complex novel core-edge infrastructures.

<br/><br />

The overall vision of RAINDROP is illustrated by the figure below.

<h2>Funding</h2>

<div style="text-align: justify;">

RAINDROP is jointly funded by UCLouvain and UNamur as part of the Actions de Recherche Concertées (ARC). It involves the <a href="https://cloudlargescale-uclouvain.github.io/" target="_blank">Cloud and Large Scale Computing</a> group (PI: Pr. Etienne Rivière) and the <a href="https://secperf-uclouvain.bitbucket.io/" target="_blank">Security and Performance of Networked Systems</a> group (PI: Pr. Ramin Sadre) at UCLouvain, the <a href="https://www.unamur.be/en/precise/" target="_blank">Research Center on Information Systems Engineering (PReCISE)</a> group (PI: Pr. Anthony Cleve) at UNamur.

<br /><br />

The project is also supported by the <a href="https://www.sofinaboel.be/accueil/" target="_blank">SofinaBoël Fund for Education and Talent</a>, which is <a href="https://newsroom.unamur.be/fr/actualites/un-chercheur-en-informatique-de-lunamur-selectionne-pour-la-prestigieuse-bourse" target="_blank">funding a research stay for Maxime André at the Software Institute (SI) of the Università della Svizzera italiana (USI) from October 2024 to March 2025</a>.
