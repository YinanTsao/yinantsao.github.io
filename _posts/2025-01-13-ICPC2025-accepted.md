<h3>A paper accepted at ICPC 2025's ERA track</h3>

The paper "Understanding Data Access in Microservices Applications Using Interactive Treemaps" has been accepted to <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/icpc-2025" target="_blank">ICPC 2025</a> (co-located with <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2025" target="_blank">ICSE 2025</a>) in the ERA track.

In this paper, we present a new approach to support the understanding of data access in microservices architectures using interactive treemaps. This result contributes in identifying technology breakdown patterns, analyzing the impact of data concept changes, comparing system versions to track evolution or refactoring scenarios, and highlighting particular code patterns. This promising approach can be used to aid in decision-making for refactoring and evolution strategies.
 
Maxime will present this paper late April 2025 in Ottawa (Canada).

This paper has been co-authored with researchers of the <a href="https://reveal.si.usi.ch/" target="_blank">REVEAL research group</a> at <a href="https://www.usi.ch/en" href="_blank">Università della Svizzera italiana (USI)</a> in Lugano (Switzerland) where Maxime is doing a research stay. This collaboration is supported by the <a href="https://www.sofinaboel.be/" target="_blank">SofinaBoël Fund for Education and Talent</a>.
