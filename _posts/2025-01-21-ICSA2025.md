<h3>A paper accepted at ICSA 2025</h3>

The paper "Data Access-centered Understanding of Microservices Architectures" has been accepted at <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/icsa-2025" target="_blank">ICSA 2025</a>.

In this NEMI paper, we present a new approach to to systematically identify and analyze data access code fragments in complex applications composed of multiple microservices and distributed across multiple codebases. This result aims to recover a holistic, data-centric view of interactions between these services and databases.
 
Maxime will present this paper early April 2025 in Odense (Danemark).
