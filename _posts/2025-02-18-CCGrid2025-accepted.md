<h3>Paper accepted at CCGrid 2025</h3>

The paper "LASSY: a Latency-Aware SLOs-Sufficing Scheduling System for the Cloud/Edge Continuum" has been accepted at <a href="https://site.uit.no/ccgrid2025/" target="_blank">CCGrid 2025</a>.

We proposed LASSY, SLO-sufficing scheduling model for the deployment of latency-sensitive monolithic applications on cloud/edge continuum. By introducing queueing theory and transfering the scheduling problem to optimization problem, LASSY accurately predicts the Round-trip time of users' requests and generates placement plans with users-to-sites mapping for latency-sensitive monolithic applications deployment among the geographically distributed sites with minimum customizable cost.
 
Yinan will present the paper in the conference during May 18th-22nd 2025 in Tromso, Norway.
