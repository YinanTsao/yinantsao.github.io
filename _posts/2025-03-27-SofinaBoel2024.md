<h3>Maxime is back in Belgium after spending 6 months in Switzerland.</h3>

Thanks to the <a href="/2024/04/25/SofinaBoel2024/">SofinaBoël Fund for Education and Talent 2024 scholarship that Maxime had the honor of receiving in March 2024</a>, he was able to enjoy an extraordinary scientific and human experience. For six months, he had the opportunity to join the <a href="https://usi.ch/" target="_blank">Università della Svizzera Italiana (USI)</a>, within the <a href="https://si.usi.ch/" target="_blank">Software Institute</a>, and more specifically the REVEAL research group, headed by <a href="https://www.inf.usi.ch/faculty/lanza/" target="_blank">Prof. Michele Lanza</a>.

During his stay, he worked on a visualization solution based on interactive treemaps, capable of displaying how microservices and their databases are structured. This makes it easier to anticipate the impact of change. This work resulted in a publication in the ERA Track of the <a href="/2025/04/27/ICPC2025/">ICPC 2025 conference</a>, held in Ottawa last April.
